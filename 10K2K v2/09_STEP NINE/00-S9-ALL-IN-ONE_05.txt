and it's really annoying but the other side of it too is just that we're kind of favoring the platform where search is right you have google search you have gemini you have all the content that's basically being fed into ai searches from from chat gpt to claude to everyone else they're all favoring kind of results that come from google which means that i

would kind of personally just tend to favor that platform anyway, since all the tech stuff is kind of behind it versus say the platform like Yelp, which really is not involved in any type of AI search or any type of general search as well. So just a quick note, if we're going to prioritize, let's do Google. Those are, it's going to be the easier one and probably the more effective one. Uh, but it's totally.

It's fine to allow other reviews to come in from other platforms. If people wanna choose Yelp, if they wanna go to other places and leave the review, we're not gonna worry about it. But in terms of when we ask them, we don't wanna give them a big list of places to give us reviews. We wanna give them one single option. And the option I would recommend is just Google. All right, now we're done.
