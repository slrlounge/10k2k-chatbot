Building website authority. I think each of you will appreciate this module. This one is very short and sweet. It's gonna be really simple. We're gonna talk about the idea of how do we go about building website authority, okay? So topics and questions here, and we're gonna talk about what that exactly means as well. But we're gonna talk briefly about how SEO rankings work. We're gonna mainly just do a review on that one. What is website authority? And once we understand it, it's kind of, well, what do I need to do to get my website to actually rank higher in search? And how do I build what's called backlinks? How do I build more of these, which we're gonna talk about in a minute.

talk about here as well. Once again, we're going fast-paced. I do expect you to pause, to implement, to repeat, come back through this again, but what I don't want you to do is just to shotgun this entire program. I want you to actually work as you go and understand that you can always pause and implement and repeat, okay? Between sessions, you have the mentorship group there to ask questions, seek advice, share wins, aha moments. I'm gonna keep this pace going, so let's just rock it. Let's end this one and head to the first lesson now.
