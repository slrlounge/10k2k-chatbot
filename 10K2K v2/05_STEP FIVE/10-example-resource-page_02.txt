for booking. Look, one of the first questions we get is, what should you wear? Here's a little article right here that I've attached. Go ahead and click that. Check it out.

Plus, we're going to use them for social media marketing, for all sorts of external uses as well on the marketing side too. So please do not sleep on this concept.

content literally is like, like all of this, this top down strategy is how we've generated at this point, I think we're approaching close to 40 million, but it's well over $30 million of revenue over the 15 years of running Lin and Jirsa just from this, only this past year, did we start doing paid ads and there's, there's reasons for that. We can talk about it later, but it's not because we had to, by the way, it's just because like, we're a different place in our family life and like, that's like.

Our focus now is let's do less and just kind of leverage something else that we can pay for. But anyway, no point in kind of worrying about that yet. My point is that we built this entire thing and we're still getting tons of leads a month from work that we did with organic content, with all these things, with resources essentially, from six, seven years ago, okay? These things will continue to give you revenue. They will continue to build up over time.
