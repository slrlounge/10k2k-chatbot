million, but it's well over $30 million of revenue over the 15 years of running Lina Gersa, just from this, only this past year, did we start doing paid ads? And there's, there's reasons for that. We can talk about it later, but it's not because we had to, by the way, it's just because like, we're a different place in our family life and like, that's like our, our focus now is let's, let's do less and, uh, and just kind of leverage something else that we can pay for. But anyway, no, no.

point and kind of worrying about that yet. My point is, is that we built this entire thing and we're still getting tons of leads a month from work that we did with organic content, with all these things, with resources essentially, from six, seven years ago, okay? These things will continue to give you revenue. They will continue to build up over time, whereas paid advertising, whereas a social media post, it's only gonna be useful for a short period for on social media, a matter of.

minutes maybe days for you know a paid ad as long as you're spending money on it don't sleep on this stuff perfect we're done
