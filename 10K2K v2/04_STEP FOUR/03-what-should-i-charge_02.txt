It's so easy to pick up the camera and create imagery, and it's going to get even easier, okay? Especially as AI tools start coming into your camera body. It's so easy to go in and write, to go and create good material, good content. All of these AI tools are just making everything. It's referred to as the democratization of production, right? As these tools make everything that much easier, our jobs isn't necessarily to focus on creating, but rather curating the right type of experience.

It's curating the right type of imagery, curating the right type of service to the clients that we're looking to serve, okay? So that's kind of how we're gonna approach this as we move forward. We're gonna use a lot of tools to do the heavy lifting, and I want you to focus on curation, all right.
