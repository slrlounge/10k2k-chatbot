Okay, so I want you to think about this before we go into the next module. How do you sell an emotional product through reason and logic? I gave you some funny and silly examples of this as we went through this, but I actually want, if there's a little bit of homework, to think about this. If you were selling a Bentley, is there anything that you could say reasonably and logically that would justify the half million dollar price? If you're selling a $5,000 photography service, logically, reasonably,

Is there anything that you can say, any reason you can give, any logic you can give to justify that price? If the answer here is Hmm, it's hard to think of reason and logical arguments for an emotional product Then the first thing we need to be working on is steering our conversations. Our sales conversations need to be Emotionally guided and stay in an emotional space Not a manipulative space but an emotional space We're gonna work through this as we go through each module We're gonna get more and more tactical as we go. But for right now, I want you just to

process kind of the mindset stuff that we discussed, and then jump into the next lesson, or module in this case.
