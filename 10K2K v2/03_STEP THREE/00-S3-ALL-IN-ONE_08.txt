And said, like, these are the experiences that I want to offer. These are the things that I've wanted to do. I've used, as you've customized that and kind of tailored that through this conversation, the better this set of instructions is going to be and the more useful the tool becomes to you and your business over time. All right. That is, I believe it for me. So let's see, once you've updated the instructions, you're good to go.

So just go ahead and and and and pause make sure that that's updated with all the new stuff I hope you're gaining comfort more and more in and kind of like leveraging AI as this powerful Basically partner in your business and if you have any questions pop them into our mentorship group. So with that this section this module

is done. And so what I would love for you to do is to start thinking about each of these things as we move forward and we're going to go ahead and build the pricing and experience guides as we go into the next module. And then as we go into step 5, module 5, that's where we're going to start implementing throughout the entire website. Again, remember, this is a process of refinement. This is a process of implementing.

going back and making tweaks. But I'm hoping at this point, you're starting to get a really good idea of where you're going in this brand and this business. We're done here.
