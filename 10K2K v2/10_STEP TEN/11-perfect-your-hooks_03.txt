I want to have a visual hook and a text hook with every single one of these things that I create. And then, you know, pepper in either a sound or a narrated or a viral hook on top of that, okay, to make something more engaging, more interesting. But a visual and a text hook, yes, every video should have those. Even when it's narrated, we should have that. All right. Okay, if there are, I don't think there are any questions on this one. We have a lot to cover, so let's just go ahead and dive into the next lesson. But not until, like.

I would like you to actually complete this assignment of creating your first talking head style or narrated video. So I'd like you to have one of these. Test it out. I want you to feel what the process is like. I want you to get the video up because this is such an easy way to directly engage with your audience to show your personality. It's such an easy style of content to add to your content buckets, which we're gonna talk about, that I don't want you to overlook this type of material. Very useful, very effective. Get after it.

Okay, now we'll go on.
