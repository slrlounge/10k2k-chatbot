If those ideas are not concrete yet, or if you need ideas, jump over to your brand strategist, use that prompt to give you ideas when you're ready to create this nurture sequence. And then once you're ready, you just say, okay, yes, draft them up. And now it's gonna write out those emails. Again, we obviously want to tailor these, customize these, make them yours, and then include them in the CRM. So use the CRM and say, this is gonna be email number one, they're gonna receive this.

this immediately upon getting their lead. Email number two, they're gonna get this three days after. Email number three, they're gonna get this five days after. And you just set the times for each of those. Once again, this is one of those nice things to have. When we look at a sample nurture sequence, when you get to the sales material, when we get to steps 12 through 15, you're gonna learn that the very first rule whenever you get a new lead is to follow the five minute rule. The five minute rule is that you call.

all of them back within five minutes. So that is the best form of connection that you can have with anybody, right? So I don't want you to feel pressured, like I gotta create this nurture sequence right now. I want you to think of this as, okay, down the road when I wanna improve my client experience further, this is an easy way for me to do that. Use it as that. Let's jump to the next video.
