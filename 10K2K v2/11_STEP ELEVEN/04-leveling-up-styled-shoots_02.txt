All right, this is your style shoot planner. What I would say is like anytime you're planning a shoot, this is helpful to print off and just to make sure, or if you wanna just keep it, you know, side by side on your computer, that's fine. But work through this list to make sure that we've planned something that is gonna be effective. And guess what? Planning out an effective styled shoot, when you do this, it takes a little bit of time, okay? It's gonna take you, I would say on average, to effectively plan a styled shoot, especially when there's partners. It's probably four to eight hours of planning, okay? Expect that. But the return for that four to eight hours of planning is absolutely insane. Because going into a styled shoot.

without a plan, number one, you're gonna shoot more images than you need and you're gonna create more work for yourself in the editing and the post-production process. Number two, you're probably not gonna get everything that you actually want, you're not gonna satisfy the relationships, you might not even be able to bring the right collaborators on board. And so what we get is like, yeah, maybe you saved a couple hours in the long run, but the effectiveness of this entire project is now diminished by like 90%. So I'd rather you spend a few extra hours in the planning process and you're gonna 10X your result than going in and just like half-assing it and getting a thousand views instead of what could have been.

have been 100,000 views. That's the difference that we're talking about, okay? So spend the time necessary to kind of plan them out effectively so that you're not wasting your time. All right, let's jump to the next lesson.
