Win-win partnerships. So this is kind of the last module inside of the marketing section of the program, which is step six through step 11. And what we wanna do here is I wanna help you to kind of identify how to boost your marketing efforts through really great collaborations. Basically, these are mutually beneficial collaborations with other vendors, with venues, potential partners across the board.

So what we're talking about here is, well, specifically some of the nuts and bolts of it, like how do I tag or collaborate with vendors? Are free shoots worth doing? What are the most effective ways, for example, of say, building a portfolio? When should I do free shoots? What are test shoots versus style shoots? We'll talk a bit about spec shoots as well. And we'll talk about this process of like, how do I network and build relationships to do these collaborative shoots, all of it, okay? So these are the questions, the topics that we're addressing. And really, when we look at the leverage.

framework, we've already covered all of these check marks. What we're looking at now is like, how can we amplify these efforts with partnerships? So this is where we are in terms of focus. Okay, once again, we're gonna go fast quickly through this, just so that it's easy for you guys to complete the modules and actually implement. So feel free to pause, implement, repeat. That's the process that I'm kind of expecting. And again, between sessions, if you have any questions at all, just jump right into the mentorship group. That's there for you to ask questions,

and to share your aha moments. into the first lesson.
