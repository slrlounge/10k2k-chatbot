Yes, now I can see that, I can recognize that. Okay, these six mistakes are so common that again, like first time going through this, you're gonna be like, I'm not gonna make any of those mistakes, I don't even wanna know what those are, that's not gonna be me. And then as soon as you start doing this process, you'll find yourself getting stuck with each one of them. So address them, it's okay, like, I'm not looking for perfection, I want you to understand this. I asked you to record all of your sales calls, I asked you to.

view them. I don't expect you move from one sales call to the next. You were making six mistakes and now you're making none. What I expect is with each one of these times through the next sales console, okay, I'm no longer making that mistake. Okay, I fixed this. And after 20 of these iterations, now you are dialed, but please give yourself some time and some patience in this process. Sales is a big thing. You're learning a, a very important skill that requires a lot of, again, unwinding, unlearning.

as well as learning and give yourself grace in that process.
