Okay, the last thing I'm going to say is just be aware of major site changes. So one of the things that I say is anytime you are doing like a theme change, major theme changes, major website design changes, they can actually impact SEO. I mean, they can actually improve SEO, they could potentially also damage it, depending on the features and the content inside that theme. So if you're making like a lateral change, like in an ideal world, if you're going from one theme, like one website design to another, if the menu structure stays the same and everything is kind of like in its...

same place, then we call it a lateral change, meaning like theoretically you can switch those things out and there's no change in SEO. The problem is that most of the time when you switch a theme, you switch a design, the menu structure has changed a little bit. It's moved to a different place, you have a different footer, you have different things around. And so there can often be an impact in that process. Usually what I say if you're at a place where like you've got something that's already good, If your website is not generating any views, if you haven't focused on SEO and this isn't a thing, like you're not getting organic views, then who gives a shit, right? Who cares? Because you can make this change.

nothing's gonna happen. But if you've got a site that's generating thousands of views a month, then what I would do is with any major overhaul is just grab an SEO expert to help consult on the process. And honestly, the easiest way is just to go to like, say, Fiverr or Upwork. Okay. Oh, I hate all the, those ads worked on me. So I would just go to Upwork or potentially go, did I not find? I feel like this is the right site. They've changed their, I hate it when they change their stuff again. All right, let's just go Fiverr. And what you're gonna look for is just a.

a person that can help with website migration. Okay, you can call it website migration, you can call it WordPress theme installation, but website migration is fine, we can go there. And you'll see like a bunch of these will pop up, right? They're gonna migrate your thing from whatever to whatever. So the more you can give them in terms of information, the better. Look for somebody that's got good reviews and make sure that they're gonna help with the SEO side. So I might even include like SEO website migration. So that way, like whatever you find, they're gonna give you.

like I'll transfer my groups one square space to another and they have like SEO kind of listed here. So I would look at their reviews, okay. And you can find somebody to do this for, you know, a hundred bucks to $500. It's not crazy expensive and it'll save you a whole boatload worth of time having to try to do it yourself and just all the headache that comes along with it. So if you're in that place, then that is the option that I would recommend. Again, if you are starting out or if you have a website and you haven't done any really SEO work for it, you can do these changes without making any major difference. If theoretically the theme that you're switching to is the same like style design, theoretically you can do that without making.

without having a affecting SEO, but sometimes weird things happen. SEO is a fickle thing. So it's just one of those things I wanted to give you a heads up about. Okay, cool beans. We're done with this section.
