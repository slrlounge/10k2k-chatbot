HUMANIZING.TELLING YOUR(BRAND) STORY! 3STEP Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

HUMANIZINGYOUR BRAND As a personal brand, you are the most powerful differentiator. As a fictitious brand, we must look to humanize as much as possible. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

WHERE DO WEUSE THIS STUFF? Your design elements, excerpts on your landing page, about me/us, within newsletter content, etc. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

LOOK TO WEAVE! Rather than blast someone with who you are, look to weave these elements into your brand. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

PLACE TO START... There’s many right ways to do this, so think of this guide as a simply a place to start. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

BRANDHUMANIZERGUIDE 3STEP Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

PERSONALCLARIFIEDMESSAGE Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com STEP ONE Your brand already has a Clarified Message, now it’s time to write one that’s just for you. Something you might include at the top of your About Us/Me page. Here are a few examples: Husband & wife wedding photographers. Parents of two beautiful children. In love with life’s perfectly imperfect moments. Branding photographer. Coffee shop dweller. Former corporate escapee who believes your story matters more than your follower count. (fictitious) Headshot photographer. Closet comedian. I make awkward people look confident and confident people look human. Dad jokes included. 

ABOUT ME*AND MYFAMILY Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com STEP TWO You (and your family) have a story. Let’s write a bit of that story now. You don’t have to go into crazy depth here, just speak a little about what you enjoy and love doing. Here are a couple examples: (Single) Most days start with coffee and a playlist — usually a mix of old soul, folk, and whatever I’m currently overplaying. I live for early morning light, long walks with nowhere to be, and the kind of conversations that skip the small talk. Life looks quieter on the outside, but it’s full — full of books, big dreams, and a deep love for the little things most people overlook. (Couple) We’re total homebodies — the kind who get overly excited about rearranging furniture, assembling 1,000-piece puzzles, or making playlists for dinner parties that may or may not happen. Our evenings usually involve candlelight, a board game or two, and some kind of overly ambitious recipe experiment. It’s calm, cozy, and our favorite kind of chaos. (Family) Most weekends you’ll find us making pancakes in pajamas, planning a spontaneous day trip to the mountains, or rewatching nature documentaries with our kids (who now think they’re junior wildlife experts). Our home runs on laughter, mismatched socks, and a never-ending pile of laundry that we pretend doesn’t exist when we’re too busy making memories.

MY PASSIONS,INTERESTS, ORHOBBIES Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com STEP THREE Whether you call them a passion, interest, or hobby-- These elements are wonderful and light little pieces of seasoning you can pepper throughout your experience. Spend a few minutes jotting these down. 

MY PERSONALVALUES OR “WHY”STATEMENT Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com STEP FOUR Your personal values or “WHY” is the reason for why you do what you do. This is where I want you to get honest and personal (at least with yourself). A lot of your WHY will be hidden behind layers of personal experiences (even trauma). Let’s write them out so you have a deeper understanding of yourself. You can always choose how much you want to share later. 

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com From what you understand about me and my brand. Can you help me rewrite and refine this [WHAT YOU’RE WRITING] and put it into my voice? I’ll place it below: [PASTE YOUR COPY] Make it yours. Then complete the section Humanizing My Brand in your workbook. AI-PROMPT Need help? Throw what you have into your Brand Strategist (or ongoing convo) and ask something like:
