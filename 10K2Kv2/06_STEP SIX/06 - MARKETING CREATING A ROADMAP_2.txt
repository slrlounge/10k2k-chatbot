AI Search is dramatically changing SEO optimization, it’s why I want you to focus on the basics (80/20 rule) AI (AEO) VS SEO Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

Chatbot (AI) referrals are currently 95.7% lower than google with just a .37% click-through. newsmedialliance.org FOR CONTEXT Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

Search Engine Optimization boils down to two components: TWO SIMPLE KEYS Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Keyword strategy (category) Website authority (relevance)

WHAT’S AKEYWORD? Phrases that help search engines know what your website and content is about. For example: Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com “San Francisco Wedding Photographer” “New York Portrait Photography” “Best Wedding Venues in Los Angeles” “Top Engagement Locations in Utah”
