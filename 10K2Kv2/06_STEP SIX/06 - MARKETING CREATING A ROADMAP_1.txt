WHAT WE THINK... Our marketing misconceptions and self-limiting beliefs: Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com “I just want to take pictures, not market” “I can’t market, I don’t know how” “Even if I get leads, they’ll just ghost me” “Lead generation is too expensive!” “I hate social media, I don’t want to dance.” “I don’t have the time to market my work” “SEO is complicated and doesn’t work” 

WHAT ISMARKETING &MARKETINGSTRATEGY 6STEP Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

MARKETING Made simple. Getting people to care about what you offer because they see the value behind what you do. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

YOUR KEY Knowing exactly who they are, what they want, what they fear, and how your offer fits them meaningfully. (You’ve solved this in Steps 1-5) Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

STRATEGY A good marketing strategy is like a table with 4+ legs. Remove one leg, it can still stand on its own. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com LEADS Content marketing - organic search - paid ads - lead magnets - giveaways - local search - organic search - events & shows - client referrals - vendor referrals - partner referrals - venue referrals - Instagram - Pinterest - YouTube

FEAR... I have to do all of this? It’s going to take me forever to learn, and 20-40 hours a week to do! Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

MARKETING Doesn’t have to take all of your time, nor does it have to be something you hate. It’s as simple as showing who you are and what you do. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com t r u t h

START WITH ONE! Start with the framework I give you, add one layer after another. If you’re going to remove one, add something else to make up for it. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

WHAT IS ORGANICMARKETING? WHYNOT PAID ADS? 6STEP Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com HONESTLY... Which party would you rather go to?

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com CONTENTMARKETING = Creating valuable content for your audience, while at the same time filling your party. (Long-term marketing assets)

EXAMPLES... Making the party look full can come by showing content from: Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Paid client shoots Test/concept shoots Friends/family shoots Styled shoots Contests and giveaways Purposeful spec work

CONTENTMARKETING = Content marketing is only effective when you’re showing imagery and inspiration that resonates with your target audience. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com PAIDMARKETING “Rented” directing marketing efforts designed to make people act quickly. (Short-term marketing assets)

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com BUT WHY? Advantages of Content Marketing over paid advertising include: DISADVANTAGES: When done effectively, paid advertising results can come immediately, content marketing takes time and effort. Effective as a long-term asset More consumer trust (68%) Up to 600% higher conversion rate FREE! No out of pocket cost

WHY NOT START W/ PAID ADS? Because until you understand your audience + ad copy, ad creative, and high-converting landing page design; paid ads = waste of money. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

IN MY OPINION... The best way to learn paid ads is to understand organic marketing while you dial in your business. (Usually 2-3 years) Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

$30M+ We’ve generated well over $30M (just in our studio) using only organic marketing up through 2024. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

OUR FOCUS... Teach you organic marketing so you can generate a lead-generating funnel that delivers value over time. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com BUT... PAID ADS? Still want paid ads? Here’s my suggestion to make it effective: Only effective while paying Ads fatigue with time 3+ Month ads budget (runway) Get a trusted coach/program Offer is dialed (conversion design) Brand is dialed (Steps 1-5)

SHORT-TERM +LONG-TERM The LEVERAGE framework is a balanced approach for generating short-term marketing results, while creating long-term marketing assets. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com
