I would recommend finding a trusted coach or program. I'm actually trying to figure out on this side like who we can potentially bring in if those of you that want to go somewhere, someone that we can recommend on that side. But for right now, let me just leave it there. And then only effective while paying. We have to remember that. It's only effective while paying. And it adds fatigue with time. Meaning you need to understand that once you have a paid ad that's working, I hear this all the time. Someone says, oh man, I just gotta get my paid ads dialed and then once they're dialed, I'm just gonna keep running them, keep scaling them. That's not the way paid ads work. As you scale a paid ad, it becomes less efficient. And over time, it becomes less efficient.

less efficient as well. Your ability, the entire premise of doing paid advertising is all about efficiency design. It's all about how do I boost conversion rates by a small amount because that makes a massive difference overall. So ads are gonna fatigue and you're constantly gonna be in the process of revamping and tweaking and adjusting. This becomes your focus in your work when you're going this route. I don't wanna discourage you from it. I want you to have a clear picture of what this is so that you're not convinced by someone that this is your silver bullet. There is no such thing, okay? There is no silver bullet. What I'm giving you, in my opinion, is the silver bullet.

It's the one that, and even then I would qualify it and say it's not that because it still takes a substantial amount of time, but once you're generating like organic content, it's this thing that's going to continue delivering for your business over time. I'll show you how exactly we're going to do it. Okay, I think we're done here. Let's jump to the next lesson.
