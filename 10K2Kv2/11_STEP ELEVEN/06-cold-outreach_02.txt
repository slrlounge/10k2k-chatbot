image that is personalized. They see a website with your photo and their website right there and they're like, man, this is actually for me. So where I ignore a phone call, where I get annoyed when someone shows up at my door, when I receive looms via email and I get a lot of these soliciting emails, I watch almost every single one of them because sometimes they have really good ideas in them and I end up hiring the person and it's custom catered to me. I can also do it. I can watch the video on my own time.

Okay, again, trick to this, keep it short, keep it sweet, keep it directed at how you're gonna help them, be solution oriented, and don't sleep on this.

This is the, if I were to only pick three, this is very likely gonna be my number three, maybe number four.

behind really well done styled or collaborative shoots. I love those too because you can get so much organic reach from them and so much social media content.

If you have any questions, just jump into the group and holler. All right, that's it.
