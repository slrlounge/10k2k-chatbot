Welcome to step eight or module eight. We are now starting with basically that SEO-driven content. So we're beginning with top-down marketing design. What we're gonna be doing here inside this module is answering these questions. So our topics and pain points is really how do we write good evergreen content? How do we optimize those articles for SEO? And how do we do all of this basically faster? So how do we do this without spending all of our time generating content and kind of being lost in this marketing cycle? Once again, my heads up for every single module is this is fast-paced. Go ahead, I want you to pause.

I want you to implement, repeat, and especially if you're coming through this a second time, there is so much to be had, like so much value to be had going through this program your second or even your third time because your eyes are gonna expand, your ability to see and understand the things that we're talking about, it's gonna change. So each time through the course, you're gonna pick up new details. That being said, pause, implement, repeat, that's kind of our process. And remember that in between sessions, you have the mentorship group to ask questions, to seek advice, to share wins or aha moments, all of that is there as well. Let's go ahead and dive into the first lesson.
