3 CALLS...3 EMAILS...MOVE ON Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 1 6 STEP

KNOW WHEN IT’STIME TO LET GO... Before we dive into objections. Let’s all recognize that at a certain point, we have to let them go! Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

HERE’S HOW... Fire off your pricing and experience guide with a simple email, and then cut them loose! For example: Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com “Hey [NAME], I’ve tried a few times to get a hold of you. I’d love to chat, but I don’t want to keep bothering you. I’ve gone ahead and attached my Experience & Price guide, if you have any questions, please [CLICK HERE] to book a free consultation.”

NOW... OBJECTIONS! One of my all-time favorite topics, let’s dive into this not-so-hairy-scary- monster of a lesson. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

ACCEPT THAT“NO” ISN’T THEPROBLEM Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 1 6 STEP

MINDSET TIME! It’s time to do some CBT rewiring! Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

YOUR RELATIONSHIPWITH MONEY... Your fears and relationship with money are going to be PAINFULLY OBVIOUS when it comes to objections Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

OBJECTIONFEAR(S): “NO” = “I did something wrong” “My work/service isn’t good enough” “I must have said something bad” “This business was a stupid idea” “I’m such an idiot for doing this” “I’m not good enough as a __________” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

MOST ARTISTS... Are so afraid of hearing objections or the dreaded “no” that we’ll avoid sales or design a sales process that makes it almost impossible to close. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

DISCONNECT ALL OF IT! Don’t assume the reason your clients have objections have anything to do with things you fear and worry about. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

BE AFRAID OF “YES” Instead of fearing a “no” recognize that “no” gives you a direction, but an empty “yes” ends the conversation. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

OBJECTIONS = BELIEFS People don’t object to facts, they object to the beliefs they hold about those facts. Address the beliefs! Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

SAMPLE BELIEFS... “This is too expensive” = I don’t know that I value this enough to spend that much money on it. “I need to think about it” = I’m worried that I’m going to make the wrong decision and regret it “Your competitors are cheaper” = I believe all options are the same, so I should be able to pay less Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

REGARDLESS... Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com These objections (beliefs) ARE NOT personal attacks on you! They’re rational thoughts/fears WE ALL have about major purchase decisions.

TAKE “NO” OUT OFYOUR VOCABULARY Despite their requests or objections, you’re going to do your best to avoid saying “no” unless you have to. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

SPEAK ONLY TOTHE BELIEF(S) We’re not going to stress about the objection, we’re going to learn to speak purely to the belief behind it. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

COMMON PHRASES... “It sounds like you feel...” “It seems like you’re worried that...” “Gotcha, you’re not sure if...” “It sounds like you really value...” “That’s a reasonable concern. “You’re right to think about this.” “I understand... but do you feel...” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com (P.S. thank you therapy)

OBJECTION:“WOW, THAT’S ALOT OF MONEY!” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 1 6 STEP

“WOW, THAT’S ALOT OF MONEY!” This is just sticker shock, they didn’t say you’re not worth the money. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

BELIEF = “That’s more than I expected.” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

“It sounds like this was more than you expected and you’re absolutely right, [PRICE] is a lot of money! At the same time, I know this is an investment in something you’ll cherish forever.” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

OBJECTION:“BUT SO-AND-SOIS CHEAPER...” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 1 6 STEP

“BUT SO-AND-SO IS CHEAPER...” Don’t be offended. They’re comparing based on what they understand. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

BELIEF = “I believe I can get the same service, imagery, and experience by hiring someone much cheaper than you.” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

“I understand that they’re cheaper, but do you feel like they’re offering the same product or value?” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

OBJECTION:“DO YOU OFFERDISCOUNTS?” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 1 6 STEP

“DO YOU OFFERDISCOUNTS?” There’s nothing wrong with asking a question that we would ALL ask! Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

BELIEF = “Sometimes businesses offer discounts, it can’t hurt to ask.” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

“Yes, we do! As you bundle more options, I can offer you package pricing which will reduce the overall cost. For example...” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

“Yes, we do! In fact, what I’ve built for you already has package pricing which has reduced the overall cost by [$$$]...” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

OBJECTION:“CAN YOU COMEDOWN ON PRICE?” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 1 6 STEP

“CAN YOU COMEDOWN ON THE PRICE?” If they have a problem with price, this will be their final question. Again, you’ll respond with a YES! Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

BELIEF = “I like what you’re offering, but I’m not sure I believe there’s enough of what I value to justify the price.” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

“Absolutely. It sounds like there might be something here that’s that’s not as important to you. Is there anything in your package that you feel like you don’t need or want? For example, if we remove [X] then I can bring the price down to [PRICE].” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

OBJECTION:“BUT IT’S NOT AWEDDING!” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 1 6 STEP

“IT’S NOT AWEDDING, SO...” “We’re not having a reception.” “Nobody is in wedding clothes.” “It’s just a party, not a wedding.” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

BELIEF = “This is probably going to be a lot less work for you, so I shouldn’t be charged the same amount.” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

“I’d be happy to give you my event rate if you’re looking for 3 hours or less of basic event coverage on a day that isn’t Saturday or Sunday.” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

“Ahh, gotcha. It sounds like your event will be smaller than a typical wedding, so I understand why you’d ask. I would do the same thing. I price based on opportunity, meaning if I take your wedding, I actually turn down any other business that comes my way. Does that make sense?” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

OBJECTION:“I HAVE TO ASK MYSPOUSE FIRST” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 1 6 STEP

“I HAVE TO ASK MYSPOUSE FIRST...” Sometimes it’s valid, sometimes this is just an excuse, either way I want you to present a solution! Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

BELIEF = “I’m not the decision maker here.” or “I want my partner to validate my decision so I don’t get in trouble.” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

“I totally understand. I want your (husband/wife/spouse) to be on the same page as well. How about we loop them into our call right now?” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com
