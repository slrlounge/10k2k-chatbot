Objection, do you offer discounts? Nothing wrong with asking a question that we would all ask, okay? Please. The reason why I keep saying that is because we get offended very easily at something that is pretty dang normal. Okay, we take it very personal when in reality this is very normal. But once again, the belief here is sometimes businesses offer discounts. It can't hurt to ask, right? It can't hurt to ask, why not? I mean, sometimes they have in their mind, well, so-and-so is cheaper. But guess what? After we address this with, yes, we actually.

do so as you bundle more as we step up in the collections I can offer you a collection price which reduces the overall cost for example so you just say yes that's already built in actually now if the real objection is this comparison objection it'll come out they'll say that next they'll say well I get it but this is still quite a bit more expensive than so-and-so or I was looking at some options that are less so it's gonna lead you to the next place in the conversation right so there's a couple ways of that that you can do this and again you can modify yes we do in fact what I've built for you already has collection pricing which is reduced the overall cost by and you can give them the number actually so any of these

would work totally fine. But no, notice that I did not say no. Just because we don't call it a discount, maybe we call it collection pricing, right? It's still, it is what it is. It is a discount. We're just using a fancier term. So I don't need to say no. I don't ever discount my work. So yes, in my collections, I offer you a savings. Cool?
