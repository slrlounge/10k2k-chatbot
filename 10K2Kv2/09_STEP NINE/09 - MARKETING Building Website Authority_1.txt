REVIEWING...SEO MADESIMPLE! 9 STEP Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

Search Engine Optimization boils down to two components: TWO SIMPLE KEYS Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Keyword strategy (category) Website authority (relevance)

YOU NOW HAVE AKEYWORD STRATEGY It’s time to move onto the second piece of SEO optimization, building website authority (relevance)! Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

WEBSITEAUTHORITY Determines the ranking or order of websites presented from search and depends on the following: Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Website and content quality Internal linking structure Domain age, site speed Inbound links (backlinks)

WHY DOES THIS MATTER? This not only affects general search visibility, but also AI search visibility which prioritizes higher-authority sources over low-credibility sources. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

SO...WHAT IS A “BACKLINK?” 9 STEP Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

WHAT IS ABACKLINK? Links from another website to yours, from a search engine’s perspective, backlinks are kind of like referrals. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

PASS ME SOME JUICE! From an SEO standpoint, every link passes a little value or “juice” from one page to the next. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

LINK JUICE Every link passes a little “juice” from one page/website to another... Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com O U T B O U N D = J u i c e t o o t h e r w e b s i t e s / p a g e s I N T E R N A L = J u i c e t o y o u r o w n p a g e s I N B O U N D = J u i c e t o y o u r w e b s i t e / p a g e s

UNLESS... When there’s a “nofollow” attribute in the HTML link code, no SEO-value or “juice” is passed by the link. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Select a link Right-click > Inspect Look for rel=”nofollow”

MOST PLATFORMS &DIRECTORIES Unless you’re specifically paying for a backlink, most platforms/directories will link to you with “nofollow” links. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

WHAT’SBACKLINKQUALITY? 9 STEP Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

NOT ALL BACKLINKSARE EQUAL... If backlinks are “referrals” then where your backlinks come from matter! Three backlink three factors: Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Q U A L I T Y = A r e t h e y r e p u t a b l e ? R E L E V A N C E = A r e t h e y o n t o p i c ? Q U A N T I T Y = S h o w s t o t a l r e a c h . 

LINKS = YOUR WORDAND REPUTATION You want reputable inbound links, and your outbound links should be to relevant and reputable websites. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

VALUE OF A LINK Here are some more factors that influence the value of a link (whether inbound or outbound): Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Reputation of link origin Relevance of link origin Location on the domain (tier 1, 2, 3) Position on page (higher = better) Number of outbound links Keywords within the anchor text Type of backlink (text > image) “nofollow” = no value

QUALITY OVERQUANTITY You’re not trying to rank against every website in the world, just against other photographers in your space. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

ONE GOODBACKLINK/MONTH Stop stressing. Set a simple goal, to get one good and relevant backlink each month. Then work toward via good directories and natural features. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com
