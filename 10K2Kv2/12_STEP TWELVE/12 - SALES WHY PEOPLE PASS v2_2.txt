WHY WOULDCLIENTS WANTTO HIRE YOU? 1 2 STEP Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

QUESTION... Why is a potential client going to hire a professional photographer, and even more so, why you? Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

WE THINK CLIENTSHIRE US BECAUSE... Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com W e h a v e g o o d l i g h t i n g / t e c h n i c a l s k i l l s W e o f f e r a p r o f e s s i o n a l p r o d u c t W e u s e p r o f e s s i o n a l g e a r W e h a v e a s t u d i o a n d r e a l b u s i n e s s

MADE SIMPLE... People buy because they trust you as their advocate and they value your understanding of their needs. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com t r u t h

QUESTION... Maybe the better question for now is, “Why don’t clients buy?” Or even, what makes them say no? Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

FIRST REASON... The first reason someone doesn’t hire us is that they’re not impressed with our brand/work. These people never become leads to begin with. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

WHEN IT’S NOTTHAT, IT’S YOU... Most of us approach sales with negative biases and/or no process. I.E. we prep the sale to be lost. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com t r u t h

NEGATIVE BIASES In sales, we’re often our own worst enemy becuase most of us: Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Don’t even understand “sales” Fear the thought of “being sold” Enter the conversation in fear Don’t believe in our service/value Fear rejection and objections Lack confidence in our price Project our own insecurities We doubt the process Are too hungry for the sale 

WHY THISMATTERS... Because I need you to stop talking about things that don’t matter to the majority of your clients. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

SALES& BUYERPSYCHOLOGY Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 1 2 STEP

THE 3 BRAINS Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com When entering a sales conversation, you need to be aware of the 3 brains: Croc Neocortex Limbic 

“CROC BRAIN” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com The brainstem or area of the brain that controls instinctual functions. The croc brain wants: Simplicity (no jargon) Summaries (no overwhelm, WIIFM) Survival (no pressure) Avoid caloric consumption Avoid loss of resources (time/money)

NEOCORTEX Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Reasoning center that wants time analyze and problem solve. The neocortex wants: Time for research Comparison of data points Space to think and process Negotiate/debate/bargain

YOUR GOALS Goal #1 = Get past the croc brain Goal #2 = Avoid the neocortex Goal #3 = Stay in the limbic system Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

LIMBIC (MIDBRAIN) Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com The emotional center of the brain responsible for stories, memories, and relationships. 

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Luxury purchases are not logical, they’re ALWAYS an emotional decision (for the most part). TRUTH BOMB t r u t h

QUESTION... But why does this matter? Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

YOUR FRUSTRATION Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Much of our frustration with sales is because we’ve created the WRONG psychological space for the sale.

WHAT WE WANT... Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com We want our clients to see the person behind the camera, and yet we spend most of our time talking about gear, photography and technique. 

THE 3 BRAINSMADE PRACTICAL Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com If you can’t get past the croc brain it’s because they see no value in what you’re offering (WIIFM?) If you keep them in the neocortex, they’ll want time to think, analyze, and bargain over price. If you keep them in the limbic system, they’ll think about what they want/value and weigh that against the cost of your service (what we want).
