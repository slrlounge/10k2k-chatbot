are like, well, who are they targeting? Are they all speaking to the same person? It's gonna give us an idea of, well, how are they speaking to that person? What are they saying? And we're gonna start noticing things that we can bring into our copy, into our experience, and not steal. We don't wanna take what they're doing and plagiarize. What we wanna do is make it our own. We wanna take what they're doing and say, I like what they said here, but this is the way that I would say that, or what I would say here is totally different, but I do like where they put that thing, and I'm gonna do something similar on my side. So we take those experiences, we build ourselves into it, and then we end up.

something totally different. But let's go through the process of actually doing this research. So we have all these ideas and we have everything that we need to basically execute quickly when we get to that space, okay? Let's jump on to the next lesson.
