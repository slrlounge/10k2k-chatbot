Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com BUT WHY? Working on your website, branding, or even your marketing efforts will likely be ineffective, and ultimately lead to a lot of re-work.

Why am I struggling to consistently attract quality leads that turn into high-paying clients? Why am I struggling to consistently generate quality leads that turn into high-paying clients? Why am I struggling to consistently convert quality leads into high-paying clients (without discounts)?

> 90% OF US Why am I struggling to consistently attract quality leads that turn into high-paying clients? Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

> 90% OF US... Decide to go pro. Rush to put up a website and portfolio. Start marketing our services (IG, paid ads, etc). Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

LEAKY BUCKETSYNDROME... Marketing without a properly established brand is like trying to capture water with a broken bucket. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

HOW? WHERE? You’ll struggle to convert views into leads, and you’ll struggle even more turning those leads into price- respecting clients. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

EFFORT = 10X-100X With a leaky bucket, you’ll work 10x to 100x harder to make the exact same amount of money. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

WHAT WE THINK... This is where our scarcity mindset and self-limiting beliefs take over: Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com “The market is just too saturated” “ C l i e n t s d o n ’ t v a l u e g o o d p h o t o g r a p h y ” “ I f I n i c h e d o w n , I ’ l l l o s e c l i e n t s ” “ C l i e n t s d o n ’ t r e s p e c t m y p r i c e s ( o r g h o s t ) ” “ I c a n ’ t c o m p e t e w i t h c h e a p p h o t o g r a p h e r s ” “ I f I r a i s e p r i c e s , I ’ l l l o s e c l i e n t s ” 

MOST OF US... Failed to build a luxury brand, then wonder why we’re not getting high- quality leads > high-paying clients. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com t r u t h

PHOTO = LUXURY No matter how you design your brand, we have to recognize that it must be positioned as a luxury brand. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com COMMODITY VS LUXURY What are the differences in these two consumer experiences? 

AND YET... Most (> 90%) of us create brands that look like a commodity, and leave our clients in a position to price shop. 🤔 Then we wonder why they do... Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com
