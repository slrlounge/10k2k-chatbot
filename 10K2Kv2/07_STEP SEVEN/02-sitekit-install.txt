Okay, so if you are a WordPress user, this video is for you. If you're not a WordPress user, you can skip this because we're gonna talk about what you need to install. But for WordPress users, you're gonna install SiteKit, okay? The beauty about this v2 version of all of this, by the way, is that now I'm gonna show you guys how to use basically ChatGPT or whatever AI you like as kind of your ultimate tech support buddy, okay? I think a lot of you already know how to do this, but it makes it so we can make these videos that much shorter and just let you get right to doing something. The instructions don't need to be as long. But what is Google SiteKit? So this is the official WordPress.

plugin by Google for, I just said that, WordPress. All right, so basically it's just a plugin on the backend and what it's gonna do is from WordPress, it's gonna install both Google Analytics as well as Google Search Console, okay? These are the two plugins that I'm gonna help you guys to install, the two kind of must-haves to basically follow your analytics and track what's going on. The nice thing with WordPress is that it comes in one plugin, you basically set it up and you get both. It automatically kind of does everything, it submits it, it's really nice what it does. So what it will do for you inside of WordPress is basically pull your kind of basic analytics right into it.

to the WordPress console. So from the same place that you're using to say, you know, adjust pages on your website or even like, you know, blog, some of you might be using ShowIt and you're using, with ShowIt, you might be using WordPress as the blog control, right? So what it allows you to do is to see analytics directly from your WordPress backend. How do you install it? This part, we gotta keep it short and simple. So look, the installation is right here. If this ever changes, I have a solution for you, but I'm not gonna walk through all of this because it's so pretty straightforward. You log in, you go to the plugins, you enter SiteKit, you follow the instructions to install, and then you basically just.

is verify, so you log into Google Search Console and Analytics, make sure the account is basically added, and if the site kit doesn't set it up automatically, you can set it up manually, and that's what we're gonna be doing next is I'll be talking about that. But this is the thing I want you to remember, you have this built-in technical support, this technical bestie that I'm gonna be referring throughout this entire module, where anytime you have a question, we're gonna go jump right over here, and if you haven't been using AI for this, you're missing out, okay? One of my favorite uses of AI is just to simply go to it and ask for help. So how do I install Google Site Kit onto my WordPress?

You don't really need to give it any more than that because the hosting and all that kind of stuff. But if you do have a question like how do I install WordPress with my host, you type that in. And it literally is going to give you the instructions, they're going to be up to date and it's going to work for you. At any point in time if you ever have a question about this, this is probably the best go-to. So rather than posting, it's funny, I went back to the slides and I was like actually with all the pause here slides, I'm like if you have a question on this, honestly just ask the GPT, it's going to give you better answers than any group could. So pause here, if you have WordPress go ahead

and get Google site kit installed and then continue from there.
