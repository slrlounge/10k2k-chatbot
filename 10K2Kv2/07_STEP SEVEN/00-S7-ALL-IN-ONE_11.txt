So I might even include like SEO website migration. So that way, like whatever you find, they're gonna give you, like I'll transfer one Squarespace to another and they have like the SEO kind of listed here. So I would look at their reviews, okay. And you can find somebody to do this for, you know, a hundred bucks to $500. It's not crazy expensive.
