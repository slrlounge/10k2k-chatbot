Okay, we are on to module 13 now, which is why people buy. So in the last module, this was really about, you know, things to stop doing, like why people don't buy from us. There's a lot of things that we're doing in the sales process that we're kind of breaking the overall sales psychology. So we talked a lot about mindset stuff. We talked a lot about the actual sales psychology. Now, as we go into why people buy, we're gonna get a bit more tactical. And with each module going forward.

we get more and more specific and more tactical as we go. So specific topics and questions we're talking about here is like, well, okay, we know what not to talk about, what should we be talking about? How do I build trust with my clients? How can I be more charismatic? How can I be more confident in my sales conversations? What questions should I be avoiding? So we're gonna get more specific into each of these. Once again, I like to mention that every one of these modules we go in a fast paced manner, please pause, please implement, please.

and with specifically the sales material, I find this stuff incredibly beneficial for you to go and actually watch, do a sales conversation, then come back to it and repeat the material because you're gonna see things in a completely different light as you get some experience, okay? And again, between sessions, remember that you have the mentorship group. It's there for you to ask questions, seek feedback, share wins, aha moments. We just had, yeah, please join us on Wednesdays, okay? Wednesdays.

are a chance to kind of share all the little to big wins that you guys are experiencing on a weekly basis, on a daily basis, and for us to be able to celebrate those moments together. So jump in on that as well. Okay, let's go on to the first lesson.
