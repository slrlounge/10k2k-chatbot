ONE OF OURBIGGEST MINDSETHURDLES 1 3 STEP Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

FEAR/SELF-DOUBT What if they control the sales conversation and don’t provide me the space to talk about their values? What if I lose control? Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

FRAMES = CONTROL In every sales situation (i.e. most conversations) I want you to understand frame control, and when appropriate, USE IT. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

THE FRENCHWAITER Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com “No, monsieur, that is not possible. That is not what we do here. But I will bring you something better.”

YOU ARE THEAUTHORITY Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Within the realm of photography, you are the authority. Don’t give up that frame control.

QUESTION... But what do you say when they’re fixated and just want the price? Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

GIVE THE DOGTHEIR BONE “My prices start at $____ and most of my clients will spend around $____. But I’d love to learn more about what you’re looking for. If I find we’re not a good fit, at least I can help recommend you to someone who is...” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com (their agreement will transfer back frame control to you)

SIMILARLY... What do you say when you’re at a wedding/shoot and your client is freaking out? Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

REASSURE THENRE-ESTABLISH “[NAME] I want you to relax. You hired me so you don’t have to stress, I’m going to take care of this. The only thing I want from you is for you to be present, happy, and engaged. Because that’s what you’re going to remember and what’s actually going to show up in a photograph. Can you do that for me?” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com (their agreement will transfer frame control back to you)

FEAR/SELF-DOUBT But what if this doesn’t work? How do I create the right (safe) space for making an emotional sale? Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

MISTAKES WE’VEADDRESSED... Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com When we fail to create the right emotional space for the sale, it’s likely we’ve also failed to: Understand their needs/values Understand what we’re selling Help them trust you as a advocate Establish YOUR VALUE 

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Again... “Sales = Curiosity.” 

GOOD CURIOSITY =STOP TALKING! Stop talking! Remember the 80/20 rule. Your 20% is to guide the conversation as you listen 80% of the time. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

24 HOURS IS FAR TOO LONG Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Whenever possible, call within 5 minutes. When it’s not possible, call the next available business hour.

WHAT TIMEOF DAY IS BEST? 4-6pm = Ideal time of contact 8-10am or 6-7pm = Second best Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com
