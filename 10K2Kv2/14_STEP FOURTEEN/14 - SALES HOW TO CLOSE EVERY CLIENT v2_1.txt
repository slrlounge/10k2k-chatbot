SLR LOUNGE 1 4 HOW TOCLOSE EVERYCLIENT STEP Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

TOPICS &QUESTIONS Here are the topics/pain points we will address in this module How do I uncover my clients needs/values? How do I hold someone in the limbic system? What’s the exact process of the WAVE? How do I present the solution? How can I confidently make the close? How do I sell without selling? Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

HEADS UP! THIS ISFAST-PACED! I believe that education must quick and simple in order to be effective. Pause, implement, and repeat. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com BETWEENSESSIONS Remember that the M e n t o r s h i p G r o u p is there for you to: Seek advice/feedback from peers Ask questions of me (or the team) Share wins or “aha” moments

WHAT’S THEVALUE OF A PHOTOGRAPH? Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 1 4 STEP

FEAR/SELF-DOUBT I’m worried that what I do isn’t worth the money. Deep down, I’m scared of charging more money for what I do. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

QUESTION What is the purpose or emotional value of a photograph? Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

ANCHORS? Poignant reminders that takes you back to a particular memory or belief. Photographs = Anchors Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 1 4 STEP EXERCISE:TESTING YOURWORTH

EXERCISE Close your eyes and think of one of your favorite photographs of you or someone you love. What do you value or appreciate about that image? Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

YOU ARE NOT APHOTOGRAPHER Your job is not to take pictures, it’s to create emotional anchors of valuable and meaningful moments. What is the value of that to a client? Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

WHAT ABOUT AI? Can AI step into a human’s life to create something tangible and real based on their values? No, this is why experiential photography is safe! Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

DURING ACONVERSATION Whenever you uncover a client’s value (or something meaningful to them), come back to that anchor often as you present a solution. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

COGNITIVEDISSONANCE Anchors are how we will help clients resolve two conflicting beliefs Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

THE (W)ALL(A)RT (V)ISION(E)XERCISE Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 1 4 STEP

THE SALESPROCESS Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Build rapport & create trust Develop value proposition Close by making the ask (value for value) Identify the customer’s problem and need Present how the solution fits the need Follow up, address objections or concerns How do you identify what your client ACTUALLY wants and needs? 

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com WANT WANT NEED NEED

PHOTO = LUXURY Cell phones have your clients covered in terms of their “need,” so we need to figure out what they “want.” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

QUESTION... What do your clients actually want? Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

EVEN WITH A MOODBOARD: What do your clients actually want? What of these images do they truly value?

AFTER BUILDING ABASIC RAPPORT... Spend 3-5 minutes in person building a rapport (30 seconds via phone), then begin the W.A.V.E. TIP: You’ll continue getting to know them through this process. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

THE WAVE The W.A.V.E. = Tried and true psychological framework to uncover EXACTLY what a client wants and values in their photography. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

THE GOAL To hold your clients in the limbic system where they can share with you a vision of an image that would be meaningful to them. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

WHAT’SIMPORTANT The image they describe is NOT nearly as important as WHY they’re choosing that image and HOW they’re choosing to describe it. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

THE SALESPROCESS Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Build rapport & create trust Develop value proposition Close by making the ask (value for value) Identify the customer’s problem and need Present how the solution fits the need Follow up, address objections or concerns As you identify needs/values start thinking of the value proposition as well

THE W.A.V.E.SCRIPT &FRAMEWORK Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 1 4 STEP

PART I Set the stage with an opening that d i s r u p t s their thought process: Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com “If it’s OK with you, I’d like to walk you through a unique visualization exercise to help me understand what you value when it comes to your photography.” [ WAIT FOR APPROVAL ]

PART II Move them into the limbic system (emotional processing) Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com “I want you to imagine your home (or apartment), and more specifically, I want you to pick a location in your home where you might hang a frame or piece of wall art.” [ LET THEM PROCESS & RESPOND ]

PART III Ask the location, and then play deeper into their vision Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com “What place are you thinking of?” (Ask both people if doing it as a couple) “Ok, so let’s imagine that space is roughly # of feet wide, is that a good approximation?” [ WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION ]

PART IV Start setting a n c h o r s while creating limitations... Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com “So I have a question, but there are a few things I want you to keep in mind. First, a professionally printed frame in that space will cost around X dollars. The price isn’t important, because you could print it on your own. But it’s either going to be an investment of your money, or your time.” [ LOOK FOR UNDERSTANDING ]

PART IV Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com “Next, your going to see this photograph multiple times each day because it’s hung in your [LOCATION]. So it needs to be something you truly love, and last. While we’re going to take tons of pictures during your [TYPE OF SHOOT] I’m going to limit you to only being able to choose ONE.” [ LOOK FOR UNDERSTANDING ] Start setting a n c h o r s while creating limitations...

PART V With the visualization set, it’s time for the KEY question... Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com “What’s the ONE photograph from your [TYPE OF SHOOT] that you would value enough to invest in and see every day in your [LOCATION]?” [ WAIT AND L I S T E N ]

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com As you listen to their responses, look for wants and values that guide you to a solution that fits them best.

PART VI After hearing their words, start inferring values to see if you’re right... Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com “OK, based on what you’re sharing with me, I’m going to take a guess at your value to put together a sort of ‘Valueboard.’ Help me know whether I’m on the mark, or if there’s anything you’d tweak.” [ SHARE & COLLABORATE ]

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com W h a t t h e y a p p r e c i a t e a n d v a l u e C o m m o n l a n g u a g e t h e y r e s o n a t e w i t h E x a c t i m a g e s y o u n e e d t o c a p t u r e W h o t h e y a r e a s p e o p l e a n d i n d i v i d u a l s A n c h o r e d y o u r p r i n t e d p r i c e p o i n t s AFTER THE WAVE... Without ever selling or even picking up your camera, you now know:

PART VII Upon finishing the WAVE, reiterate some of the things you’ve learned and set a cognitive dissonance anchor Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com “I love this exercise because as your photographer, don’t you feel that it’s critical that I know exactly what you appreciate and value?” [ WAIT FOR THEM TO A G R E E ]

STICK WITH IT! Knowing how to do the WAVE and actually doing the WAVE are two completely different things. Be prepared to suck at this at first. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

COMMONW.A.V.E.MISTAKES Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 1 4 STEP

MISTAKE #1 Don’t treat the WAVE like a script that you memorize verbatim Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

MISTAKE #2 Forcing someone into the WAVE without properly addressing questions or concerns first (pricing) Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

MISTAKE #3 Moving from one step of the WAVE to the next when someone is stuck or not understanding the prior step Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

MISTAKE #4 Not playing in deeper to understand and fully describe the “one single image” they end up choosing Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

MISTAKE #5 Thinking the WAVE is about the “one single image” rather than about the reason WHY they’re choosing it Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

MISTAKE #6 Not applying their WHYs to create the “Valueboard” and at the same time showing them practically how it changes your approach to the shoot Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com
