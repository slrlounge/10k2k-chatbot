All right, wrapping up this module, remember that your complete sales handbook. So I have a handbook that I've given you that gives you not only because following the lectures, it can be difficult to remember the exact things that we're saying and how we're approaching it. So I've given you a handbook. That handbook literally has all of it. It's in your brand and strategy guide, so it's under the resources as well. But it's basically a summary of all the scripts and what I've done as well in this, I'll just go ahead and pull it up so you guys can see it. What I've also done in this is I've broken.

this out to cover kind of all the different psychology we've talked about in case at any point you wanna give this to somebody that's gonna handle your sales process or if you just wanna review it yourself. And then there's also a script and role-playing section here where I kind of give you ideas on how this script changes based on if we're looking at a wedding, if we're looking at boudoir, if we're looking at family maternity, pet photography, if it's commercial, corporate clients, obviously it's gonna shift a little bit there. It's gonna be the same basic principles.

although some of the words are gonna shift a bit. Like again, going back to that boudoir example, it'd be weird to be like, which one of these naked photographs of you would you like to hang up on the wall of your home? That doesn't make any sense. So we kind of transpose it into say an album, like a boudoir album. We changed a little bit of the wording, but this gives you a quick reference guide. And also it's gonna have like details on the phone consultations, which we're gonna cover in the next module, as well as objection handling, which we're gonna cover as well. So use this as a reference to all the material.

that we've discussed here and holler if you have any questions.
