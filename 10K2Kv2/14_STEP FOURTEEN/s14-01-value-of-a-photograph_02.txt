resolve those two conflicting beliefs. And by the way, two conflicting beliefs in psychology terms, this is called cognitive dissonance. This happens all the time. And so typically in the sales space, those two conflicting beliefs is I need to get what I want, but I also want to get what I, I also want to pay what I want to pay. I don't want to go over that amount. Now, oftentimes we're willing to adjust how much we want to spend if the service is what we truly want. And that's what we're really saying here is we create.

these anchor points in this conversation so that someone can as they're evaluating as they're thinking to themselves like what do I really want they can actually weigh those wants against what they expected to spend okay and that's where they can make a decision like well if we go with you know Alessandro then we are going to spend a little bit more money and originally I didn't want to do that but I really feel like he understands what we're looking for I really feel like Carmen knows the types of newborn photos that we want

want to have. I really feel like James can just kill it with our kids' senior portraits, you know, with sports kind of photos. I feel like he'd do such a good job with that. And that belief is how I would resolve, well, I didn't want to spend this much, but I really do want that thing. This is the importance of these anchors, and in understanding what it is that we're doing in creating a photograph, but also in understanding how we.

can anchor specific values within the sales consultation itself. Okay, we're gonna keep going because I know a lot of this feels theoretical and it's not, this is very tactical but it's one of those things that you have to implement, that you have to actually practice and see it happening to kind of realize what exactly is going on and that's gonna come with a bit of time. So let's keep going.
