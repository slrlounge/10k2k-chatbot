this is the plugin for WordPress, meaning like what you're doing is you're downloading WordPress and installing it into your own hosting solution, okay? Now you don't need to download it here and install it because most platforms, WordPress is such a popular content management system that most platforms have it automatically built in. So if you use GoDaddy, if you use Bluehost, if you use any of these popular hosting companies, then you'll notice that they have.

WordPress installations already built in. I just want you to understand the distinction between these. We're not talking about WordPress.com. I'd honestly say that this is a less kind of good version of Squarespace. There are areas, there are things about it that make it more powerful. Like it has a good website builder, but again, I don't want you to build a website. I forgot where the website, there it is, website builder. I don't want you to build a website. This is like, again, spending time doing things that we really shouldn't have to be.

worrying about. Okay let's go jump back here for one second. I think we covered everything in terms of kind of the platform choice what kind of to avoid. Let's go ahead and jump to the next lesson.
