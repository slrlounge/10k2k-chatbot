Your final grunt test, honestly this will be something that you probably do more than once, but once you get your website up, right, your portfolio's in place, you've got the landing page, you've got kind of the designs, your clarified message, most of the meat is into the website and you're like, man, this is good to go, I wanna publish this. I'm gonna give you a little grunt test. And the grunt test is this idea, this concept that came from Donald Miller in building a story brand. The concept is that even a caveman should be able to quickly understand exactly what you're offering and how it's gonna benefit them or make their life better. So the grunt test is really easy. Now what you're gonna do is work through this checklist. Number one.

Number one, is there clarity on my offerings? Okay, within five seconds, can someone be crystal clear about what it is that I do, what niche I serve, and what type of services that I offer? Number two, is there visual impact? Is the first image shown impactful, emotionally meaningful to my target audience avatar? Number three, are there strong CTAs throughout each page scroll? Basically one on each page scroll. If you feel like it doesn't fit in certain places, fine. But just as a general idea, general guide, each page scroll usually has a CTA to the most relevant next step, okay?

uh, to, to kind of help with their discovery process. All right, four, are there strong elements of social proof that are kind of peppered throughout testimonials, reviews, awards, things that can help people further trust my brand five, fast loading speed. This is a big one. Want to make sure that the images on your website are optimized so you can use something like JPEG mini. There's plenty of different compassion, uh, compression software out there that will basically shrink down those files when you, so that way, when you put images on your website, it automatically is just going to load up faster, right? We want to make sure that we're compressing sometimes like, like if you're using a pixie set or square space, sometimes they actually build in compression into.

it where if you're putting you know images and it'll do it for you and that's great it'll save you a little step there want to make sure that the pages are loading quickly OK there's by the way a lot of different if you simply go to like search and just type in like test website speed we talk about this more when we get to SEO but there's plenty of different like free like Pingdom will give you like a free website speed test where it'll actually analyze and look at how fast it's loading what I want you to recognize that photography websites in general will be slower than most OK we just don't want to be slow for a photography website because

Websites are very image heavy. So it is going to be slower than most automatically, but we want to make sure that the website Images that they're optimized. Okay, we'll speak more about that a little bit later But just understand that that's a step here. I want to make sure that it's responsive design So for mobile, it looks good on mobile looks good on an iPad. It looks good on desktop. We've tested it We know the websites looking great across the board easy navigation. The menu is clear. It's concise It makes it easy for visitors to navigate It has your contact information not only in the menu but throughout the website itself And we've also included our email and phone number including your phone numbers ideal Some people don't want to because maybe you don't want a client calling you

And honestly, I wouldn't put your phone number on to say the contact page because I want them to give me their email and phone number so I can call them immediately. But somewhere on your website, like in a footer, you might include like an email or phone number. The main thing is that the contact menu is easy to find and that you have CTAs to contact you throughout the website to kind of get them moving towards the booking process. Step nine, portfolio design. So each image of my portfolio is not only strong, they all emotionally resonate with my target audience. They're all better than the last. It follows the portfolio checklist, all of it, okay? Step 10, the value proposition. Every component of my website.

up to convey value and a unique experience to my target audience. So this is your checklist that we want to make sure that we have checked off and if there's any of these that you question, post the section, like take the, whenever you're asking for feedback in the mentorship group, one of the things that's really helpful is to say like, Hey, I'm wondering if my website's portfolio design is ideal. I've included a screenshot. Here's the link. Take a look, give us some information there and, and send us like when you ask peers or me to look at something, give us one thing to look at. Like if you post in the group and you say, Hey, can you review my website?

that is a daunting task and I would reserve those for like full website audits right and it's a daunting task for not only me but for for just your peers to be able to give you feedback on so when you want feedback in any of these areas kind of post what it is that you're looking to do and ask for one area of feedback and that really improves the quality of feedback that you'll receive okay so this is your grunt test checklist we're good to go let's hit the next lesson
