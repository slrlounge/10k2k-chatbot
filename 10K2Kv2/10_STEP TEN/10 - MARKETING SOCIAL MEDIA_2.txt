EVERYONE’S FIRSTQUESTION... “How do I get more views?” Instead of this, we should ask: “How do I get the RIGHT views?” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

“I GET NO VIEWS!” Most photographer’s posts go unseen because they don’t know: Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com WHAT they're selling or promoting WHO they're trying to communicating with WHY their message matters

ONE MORE THING... When we say “viralize” it’s ALWAYS in context of reaching more of the RIGHT audience. Here’s why... Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

DO YOU AGREE? Every one of you has the ability to reach 100+ views on social media right now. We laugh at that number, but here’s why it’s a big deal. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

EVERYALGORITHMWANTS AWT Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com BEST PART... When it comes to today’s algorithms, your follower count doesn’t matter! Your reach is mostly dictated by the quality of your content via AWT.

MADE SIMPLE... It’s all about the average % of your video that your audience watches Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 30% AWT = G O O D “I’ll serve it to some” 70% AWT = G R E A T “I’ll serve it to more” 100%+ AWT = F A N T A S T I C ! “I’ll serve it to much more”

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com IS HE THEJERKY GUY? No. He’s the guy that tells jokes on TikTok/Instagram. So what happens to his AWT when he uploads a video about jerky (or anything that’s not a joke)? @jeremy_littel CASE STUDY CONT.

SHORT-FORM IS NOT! SHORT-FORM IS... TIKTOK, IG REELS, OR YT SHORTS PROVIDING VALUE IN 30-90 SECONDS GOING TO GROW AS A MEDIUM A TRANSFERABLE SKILLSET LEARNING HOW TO COMMUNICATE DANCING AND FOLLOWING TRENDS ABOUT GAMING THE ALGORITHM These are platforms and platforms come and go. You're here to learn principles and frameworks of good content that never change. Short-form is learning how to effectively engage, provide value, and communicate with your audience in short (30-90 second) windows. With more distractions and more content, short-form is the bridge to helping your audience know what's worth their time and resources. Platforms can come and go, what you're learning will apply to every platform as well as your ability to communicate in real life Short-form is learning how to understand any audience and communicate in a matter they appreciate and value. While you can if you want, we've never had to dance or follow trends to reach millions of people. Trying to outsmart the algorithms is virtually impossible, and even if you can, such a technique only works for a short time. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com
