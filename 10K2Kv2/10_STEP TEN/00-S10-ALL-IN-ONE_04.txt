and post it as a carousel. It's gonna do 10 times better than just a static image, okay? And why? You're gonna learn because if people are swiping, the main metric that we're gonna be talking about is average watch time. They're gonna be staying on the page longer as they swipe to look through it, and so the algorithm is gonna feed it to more people because they're staying longer. Whereas a static image, they just swipe right by it, they spend hardly any time on it, the algorithm doesn't care and doesn't feed it to more. So I really would rather you post images if you're gonna post them on their own, just as carousel posts instead of static images, okay? But this is your content power chart. Short form is incredibly powerful, and the reason why is to me, I feel like short form is the ultimate bridge content, okay? The reason why we focus in on this is because short form is engaging, meaning it's simple and they tend to be interesting to watch, right? It's hard for us to create 10 minutes worth of video content where we're just like, you know, hitting hard nonstop and keeping somebody engaged. But I can keep someone engaged for 15 seconds pretty easily. That's not that difficult. So.

It's relatively simple to create, easy to watch and interesting as well, it's engaging. The other side of this is that it's personable. So we can build, you know, we work hard on building a lot of your personality into your website, but through an actual video, you connect with me on a level that is unlike anything I'm gonna see, unlike any sort of static image or anything you write up. So it's personable, it builds trust with your audience. They're easy and time efficient to create, relatively compared to like say long form content, which if you wanna make good long form content for say YouTube, that is difficult. Like we could spend 40 hours on one video. It's a different business altogether. That's why I'm like, let's not go that route, right? So it's easy and time efficient. We can create something in 15, 20 minutes, especially when you get good at this process, you'll find it can be even faster, okay? At the beginning, it's gonna take a bit more time. But I also believe that it's here to stay. So no matter the platform, no matter what people call it, I don't care if it's a short today and if it's a real tomorrow, and if it's a, you know, whatever the names are, the names are bullshit. The platforms are frankly kind of bullshit too, because the platforms can kind of come and go, right? But what's gonna happen is that short form.

is here to stay, why? Because the phone is here to stay. We're all on our phones constantly and it's the easiest way to absorb content is through some sort of platform that feeds it to us and we're there socializing and looking at things. Now the platforms could change over time but the actual practice of it is, in my opinion, not gonna change, at least not gonna change dramatically. So it's a fantastic piece of bridge content because no matter where we go, we get this easy way to create engaging, personable and interesting material. And it's this bridge. Look, I don't know you and you don't know me. Let's say we're on the outside on social media, right? I don't know you, you don't know me but before I ask you to go look at my website, before I ask you to do something, this short form content creates a little bit of a bridge like, hey, look, you don't gotta spend two minutes, three minutes doing something. You don't gotta go listen to a podcast. You don't gotta go to YouTube. Here's 15 seconds of who I am. It's a bridge. It allows us to quickly develop a bit of trust, a little bit of a relationship before that person goes, okay, I'm gonna click because I want to go deeper. That's what I mean by bridge.

content. This is the purpose of it. It allows somebody to develop the relationship with your brand until they're comfortable crossing the bridge to interact with you. And it's in a very non-committal way, which let's be honest, everybody's moving towards non-committal everything. Anyway, that's a different topic. But look, the other aspect of this is that short-form content is probably one of the quickest ways to get results when it comes to marketing your business. Like in terms of speed to market, I would contrast short-form content with paid ads. Now, the difference is paid ads are instantly out there when you're paying for them. And we have to get the targeting right on those, right? We kind of have to do the same thing with our short-form content. We just don't have control of the targeting as much as we might on paid ads. Like on paid ads, we can literally create an ad and then only show it to certain people. In content marketing and short-form, we create that same material, but we rely on the material and the algorithm itself to feed it to the right people, if that makes sense. But in terms of speed, this is that lever that we can pull on to get more business into our, more business into our business quickly.

Okay. So everyone's first question. So now that we understand like why short form content, why is this going to be the place that we're going to emphasize? Usually the next question that I get is how do I get more views, more views? How do I go viral? How do I? And instead of that question, what I want each of you to think about is how do I get the right views? This is so much better as a question. Okay. Now, when it comes to, and we're going to talk more about this, but when it comes to this idea of like, I'm getting no views, most photographers posts are going unseen. This is the 90%. So before we even get to creating good quality content, they done gone up multiple stages ago, because they don't know what they're selling. They don't know what they're promoting. They don't know who they're trying to communicate with. They don't know why their message matters. These are all problems that you all have resolved, right? At this point in the program, we have that laid out. It's why we did that work. But excuse me, I'm getting so into this. I love this material and it's got me coughing. Okay. It's got me coughing. Look, I want to show this to you and illustrate it in a very clear point to tell you.

you why we shouldn't be concerned about just views, but more so the right views to illustrate like what the concept is. Whenever we market blind, right? When we market blind, what we're gonna end up with is one of two results. We're either gonna have failure to launch, meaning that our brand gets no views and we're stuck in this place because we're marketing blind, right? So failure to launch is our videos just don't get seen, our brand doesn't grow, all of that. Or we're gonna end up with vanity metrics, meaning we might luck our way. We luck our way into something that actually succeeds and it gets 100,000 views and we're like, oh my goodness, we're getting views, that's amazing. But they're vanity metrics because those views go absolutely nowhere. So what are vanity metrics? Well, it's tons of effort, we get millions of these followers and then we get little to no actual sales. And if you think I'm BSing you right now, I wanted to give you a case study, a real case study. I watched Jeremy Little, when I was doing my TikTok experiment and I took my account from zero to 1.4 million in six months, another creator popped on there, his name was Jeremy Little, okay? This is back in 2020. And I watched him as he grew his platform.

And he was growing quickly. And what he was growing quickly with was telling jokes. Now, this is the funny part, is Jeremy outpaced me and now today, like if you look at the account, I stopped the whole thing. Who knows where we would have been if I continued. But now today he's at 4.6 million. He has 61 million likes on his videos. Not views, he's probably in the billions of views. He's got 61 million likes, okay? This is a lot. Now, I want you, if you're watching this live, if you're not, you can put it in the comments. But if you're watching this live, I want you to guess how many sales he got. And you're probably wondering like, sales of what? Because I was wondering, sales of what? It wasn't until six months later of following this guy that I realized Jeremy's selling beef jerky. He's actually selling beef jerky. And so today, you can go to his account and you can literally see, this is his beef jerky that he sells. Look at this, there are 100 sold. I mean, you'd want this to be like 10,000.

and plus sold, right? His best offer, number one best-selling shop, eight sold. Zesty Teriyaki Beef, two sold. This is his number one bestseller. It's not like we're selling a high-ticket product here. This isn't, you know, $2,500, it's $22. And frankly, for beef jerky, that's cheap, right? Depending on how many ounces you get. Eight. Would any of you have guessed 4.6 million followers and eight sales? Is that insane? To me, that's insane. So the point of all of this is to understand, this is the concept of vanity metrics. Yeah, he can say that he's got 4.6 million followers, a billion views, but what is the mother-effing point of all of it? Not all views are good views, and you can actually damage your overall brand without a clear vision and focus. And point being, does anybody know Jeremy Little as the jerky guy? It took me six months to even realize the dude was selling jerky. No, everybody.
