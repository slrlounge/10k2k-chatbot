Okay, or you can do, he made us feel at ease. He guided us through every pose. That's another line. You could actually take this exact review and you could repurpose this into four or five different review videos all with different opening hooks and then show the images. And you can see it. You can just sort of start it like with the word review and like your hook in quotes. Correct, I would say review, five stars, and then I would say that one line. And then I would say, wait for the photos. Okay, or here are the photos. We still want to, so I love the idea for it, but the ultimate thing is we still want it to be a piece of content that's gonna be viral. And if you notice, like again, views aren't always the best metric, but you can tell that like this kind of fell off compared to his normal that would get maybe 500 to 700. This kind of fell off a bit, has 128. Right, it's hard to capture. It's hard to read. This has 373. Tim shows his face.

It has 1,500, right? Look, 1,500, 400. So I like the concept, but we have to make sure that we execute in a way that's still palatable. We have to bring our storytelling to the platform, to the format that we're sharing.
