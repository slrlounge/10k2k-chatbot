BASICPROMPTING You’re asking the AI questions, like a search engine E X A M P L E ( S ) : “What’s the best way to learn photography?” “What’s a good name for my business?” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

CONTEXTUALPROMPTING You learn that specificity matters in getting the results you want. E X A M P L E ( S ) : “Write me a funny Instagram caption assuming I’m a [niche] photographer targeting [client description] and posting about the importance of [topic].” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

ROLE-BASEDPROMPTING You begin to treat the AI like a collaborative partner. E X A M P L E ( S ) : “Let’s assume you’re a brand strategist. Based on my photography business which serves [clients] in the [niche] space, what’s a compelling Clarified Message? Now give me five variations using different tones. Let’s keep it between 8-12 words.” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

FRAMEWORKS,TEMPLATES, PROMPTCHAINING You begin systemizing prompt construction and chain-of-thought- prompting (what we’ll do here). E X A M P L E ( S ) : “You’re an expert on sales psychology. Using the W.A.V.E. framework in the Sales Handbook that I’ve uploaded, I want you to analyze my sales transcript to tell me where I went wrong.” Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 

PROJECTS, CUSTOMGPTS, AND APIINTEGRATION You create complete systematic instructions to start turning prompting into product development E X A M P L E ( S ) : Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

MY GOAL FOR YOU I want you to land somewhere between Level 4 and Level 5 by the end of this module. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

TO START Let’s create a New Project in Chat GPT (or your favorite AI) so we can focus on prompt-chaining (Level 4). If you don’t have access to Chat GPT or this feature, just follow along. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com In a moment, we're going to work through a series of prompts. When I finish this entire process, I'd like for you to create me a set of instructions that I can add to this project to tailor the way you [NAME OF AI] respond in this project. Can you do that for me? I’ll let you know when I’m done with the entire prompt chain. After that, you can go ahead and create the instructions. You may need a Premium account for advanced features (projects, custom, etc) AI-PROMPT We’re going to start this Project with our goal in mind.

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com PAUSE HERE Continue with the program as soon as your project is set up. If you’re unable to create project, simply use a regular chat and focus on the process.
