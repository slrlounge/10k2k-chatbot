Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Let’s continue building out my dream client avatar. In this step, help me understand the common problems and challenges my ideal client faces— both in the process of hiring a photographer and during the experience itself. Please include logistical concerns as well as internal or emotional challenges. For example: What challenges do they face hiring the right photographer? Are there other vendors they need to book (and how do those choices affect their stress or decision-making)? How do they evaluate and choose the right vendors overall? Do they need help with styling, wardrobe, or what to wear? Are there mindset challenges (such as body image concerns, feeling awkward in front of the camera, fear of not looking good, etc.)— especially relevant in niches like boudoir, personal branding, or family photography? Feel free to expand beyond these examples. The goal is to give me a clear picture of what my client is struggling with, so I can meet them with empathy, clarity, and support. From here, go ahead and complete the Avatar Problems/Challenges section. AI-PROMPT Using your favorite AI, continue with this next problems/challenges prompt.

CREATE A SHORTDESCRIPTION Write a short description of your dream client avatar that you can quickly reference as needed. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com STEP FIVE

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Now that you’ve helped me build a complete profile of my ideal client, I’d like your help summarizing it into a short, easy-to- reference description. Please create a concise one-paragraph summary that captures the essence of my dream client. This should include both demographic and psychographic details, as well as a brief reference to their wants, needs, and challenges. The goal is for this to serve as a clear reminder of who I’m speaking to in my marketing, branding, sales conversations, and client experience—so I can stay aligned with them in everything I do. Go ahead and reword to your liking, then complete your Brief Avatar Description. AI-PROMPT Using your favorite AI, continue with this final summary prompt.
