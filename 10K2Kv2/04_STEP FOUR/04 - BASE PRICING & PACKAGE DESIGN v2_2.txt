HOW TO USEAI & PYE’SPRICINGCOACH 4STEP Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com I’m a photographer looking to create inclusive pricing collections (NOT in- person sales). I want help designing upfront packages that align with a luxury client experience and support long-term financial sustainability. Please start by asking me the following: (1) What’s my niche? (2) Where am I located? (3) What’s my experience level—new, established, or well-known? (4) Do I have a brand strategy or audience description? (5) Do I want you to review existing packages or create new ones? Once I answer, analyze the top 3–5 competitors in my niche and region who also use inclusive pricing. Identify their package structure, pricing tiers, and what they include. Then, recommend a 3-tier pricing model using luxury- focused language: label tiers as Best (Top), Better (Middle), and Good (Entry). Make sure each tier offers clearly scaled value—ideally doubling the experience per tier while increasing the price by only 30–50% (except for the anchor package which can be a bit more). Focus on high-value experiences, not filler. Base your pricing suggestions on my experience level, positioning me just below the local average to create a compelling value. Finally, be honest: flag any pricing under $1,000 per portrait session or $2,500 per wedding as unsustainable long-term. Show how my pricing could scale to earn $100K+ per year, and summarize everything clearly—collection names, prices, and bullet-point contents. Won’t be as powerful as the Pricing Coach, but it will still get you great information. AI-PROMPT Use this standalone prompt if you don’t have access to the Custom GPTs.

BUILDING YOUREXPERIENCE &PRICE GUIDE 4STEP Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

PACKAGES Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com STEP ONE Design out your packages or “collections” that fit your target audiences needs. Once you feel like they’re dialed in, feed it into your Pricing Coach (Inclusive) for feedback. Remember: Sell “solutions” not just a package Your base package is still “viable” on its own Your middle package is your ideal sell Middle is ideally 2x the value at around 30-50% more Your anchor package should not contain junk! Anchor is ideally 2-3x the value around 50-100% more Guarantee album sales by building it into all

PRICING Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com STEP TWO Go ahead and finalize your pricing based on your level of experience and market considerations. I’d suggest you also check these against the financial lessons at the end of this module. But for now, remember: My Pricing Coach will give you ideas, not decisions! Your prices should make sense (in your market) Make sure your packages can’t be “gamed” Remove commas, remove cents Simple, small font, with price at bottom right Build in taxes, round numbers to 4's and 9's Your breaking point are 5's 

EXPERIENCE Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com STEP THREE The “experience” portion of your guide should always precede the actual prices. Value before prices! What you put in your experience guide should somewhat mirror the landing page of your website. For example a full Price & Experience Guide might include the following: NOTE: Use the templates provided as a guide, and know that you don’t have to include everything within them. Need help writing a section? Use your AI tools & coaches! Welcome w/ Clarified Message Introduce yourself (About Me) Your process (steps 1, 2, 3, etc) Sample imagery (optional) What to expect Collections/pricing Additional add-ons or details (if applicable) Recommendations/guides/checklists (optional) What’s next (CTA to phone call)
