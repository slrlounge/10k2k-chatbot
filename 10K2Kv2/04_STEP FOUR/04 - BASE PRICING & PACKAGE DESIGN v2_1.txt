THE TWOPRICING/BUSINESSMODELS Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com 4STEP

INCLUSIVE Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Ideal within wedding/events where it’s expected to receive all of the digital images with their purchase. High upfront cost/session fee All digitals (or at least a good #) Product sales = icing on the cake

IN-PERSON SALES Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Ideal within portrait niches since it’s hard justifying $1,500+ before the value/experience is felt first hand. Low upfront session fee No digitals included Albums/prints is the service

WHAT ABOUT AHYBRID APPROACH? No. Plain and simple, don’t do it. Creates complexity. Friction within the client experience. Etc... Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

COMPARINGMODELS INCLUSIVE IPS Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Simple & straight forward Less time consuming Guaranteed earnings Greater earning potential End-to-end service Greater value offering

MY TAKE... Portrait business, I would choose an IPS business model. Wedding or event, I would choose inclusive. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

THIS MODULE =INCLUSIVE Package Pricing = Inclusive. For IPS pricing (and workflow) please check out the IPS Booster Module. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

IF YOU’RE IPS... Don’t skip this module. Just skip the parts where we build and price “packages/collection” – You’ll use a different system (IPS Booster) Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

PACKAGEPSYCHOLOGY& DESIGN 4STEP Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com The easiest way to sell a $1,000 purse is to place it next to another purse that costs $10,000. $1,000 PURSE

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com PACKAGE IV (BEST) = PRICE ANCHOR PACKAGE I (MINIMAL) = I.E. ELOPEMENT PACKAGE III (BETTER) = DESIRED SELL PACKAGE II (GOOD) = MVP

WHAT DO IPUT IN EACHPACKAGE? 4STEP Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

THINK SOLUTIONS! Each package should be a solution for a specific client need, not simply a random collection of bullshit. Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com t r u t h

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Minimum Viable Product. Start here. Mind you, this is NOT a shitty package that nobody will want, or be forced to upgrade. MVP

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com WEDDING 6 Hours of Wedding Coverage Lead photographer only High Resolution Images $500 Album Credit If you want to sell albums, include it in your MVP!

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com PORTRAIT 5 Retouched Images 30 Minute Portrait Session $250 Album/Wall Art Credit

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Ideal sell. This middle package should be designed to include all of their primary wants/needs. Start including incentives (10-30% ) shown as $5,000 ($5,500 value) Aim for 2x the perceived value while around only 30% more in cost BETTER

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com WEDDING 8 Hours of Wedding Coverage Lead + Second Shooter High Resolution Images Signature Wedding Album Watch your pricing! Clients often try to remove the album to get back to MVP

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com PORTRAIT 10 Retouched Images 1 Hour Portrait Session $500 Album/Wall Art Credit

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com BEST Your dream package should include everything a client would want (not things they don’t). Continue including incentives (20-30% ) shown as $6,400 ($8,000 value) Again, aim for 2-3x the perceived value while around 50-100% more in cost

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com WEDDING 12 Hours of Wedding Coverage 2 Hour Engagement Session Lead + Second Shooter High Resolution Images Signature Wedding Album 2x Duplicate Parent Albums Including items that they won't want will make your price anchor useless.

NAMES,NUMBERS & NUANCES 4STEP Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Avoid bronze, silver, gold because one is clearly better than the other. KEEP NAMESNEUTRAL & POSITIVE

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com SUGGESTION The Pricing Coach will give you ideas. Keep your collection names short and tie it to your brand identity. Sequential Numbers (works) Mountains/Lakes (adventure brands) Favorite Locations (destination brands)

Ⓒ SLR Lounge www.slrloungeworkshops.com Based on what you know about my photography brand — including the tone, target audience, and emotional/experiential positioning — can you suggest five different naming concepts or themes I could use for my packages or collections? I’d like each concept to reflect my brand strategy and appeal to my ideal clients. Please include a short explanation of each concept and a few sample package names under each one. Play with it. Rework/curate. Then complete your collection names. AI-PROMPT Need ideas? Use a prompt like this with the Pricing Coach (covered shortly)...
