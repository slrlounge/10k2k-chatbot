is I want you to consider splitting the pricing and experience guide into both a pricing and an experience guide. So pricing guide and an experience guide, having them separate. You can also have them combined. So you can have basically three versions, right? The reason is, is you will often be in a situation where you just wanna send somebody the experience guide. You'll sometimes be in a situation where you're like, okay, this lead is done, I can't get ahold of them and I need to send them my pricing and experience guide. So having these things split off gives you the.

to kind of like send one thing or the other when needed. You don't always have to send the pricing along with the experience guide. Especially like onboarding, like it's nice if you've signed a client and you've onboarded them. If you have the experience guide separated out, you can send them that. It's weird if you've sold me, you've already onboarded me, you've already sold me and during this onboarding process, you send me a pricing and experience guide. And you're like, oh, ignore the pricing part, just look at the experience part. That to me is very strange. So just an idea here.

to separate these things out, so you can use them in different steps of your client experience and workflow, okay? All right, now let's get into the goodies. Let's actually start designing.
