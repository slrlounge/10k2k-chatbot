that I think is a relevant question, which is like with IPS, if you have a higher session fee, would you include part of it as like a print credit? And this is an optional thing to you. Again, we'll talk more about this stuff specifically in the IPS Booster module. That's where I want you to go for all this. But just to give a quick answer on that, it kind of depends. You can offer a print credit with it, or you can simply say prints and everything is not included. That's totally fine as well. I've seen it both ways. There's not really a super.

valuable thing to having a print credit because people generally know that if you're offering a print credit that your prices are high they're kind of trained and aware on that at this point so it's not like you know they're like oh this is a big thing for me. Okay that's it for this little kind of primer on these two models let's go ahead and dive into this module further with the next lesson and continue with this process of kind of building out our pricing and packages.
